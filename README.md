## Simple Spotify API console client
The purpose of the app was learning some Scala and playing with Spotify Web API.
To run it you need to change Config.scala.sample to Config.sample and supply your own Spotify app keys.

So far it is in its early stage. In the future I am planning to add some functionalities based on audio features of the tracks (some statistics, filtering and maybe clustering)
